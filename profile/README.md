### ðŸ’¡ FAQ

#### Will Inline be open source?

Currently, we don't think open sourcing our early product will be net positive for our users given the additional overhead. We are, however, considering to open source parts or even whole client apps in the future. Please share your thoughts with us.

#### What's your tech stack?

We use Swift for our macOS and iOS apps. Mostly Swift UI, with core components such as message list and text editor in UIKit/AppKit. 
We use Bun on the server with a Postgres database. 
Upcoming: Our web app will be in React, as that's what we're most comfortable in. Android will use Kotlin. We have not decided for Windows and Linux yet as there are several choices.

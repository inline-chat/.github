### ðŸ’¡ FAQ

#### Will Inline be open source?

At the moment, open-sourcing our product in early development will not be a net positive for our users, given the additional overhead. We are, however, considering open-sourcing parts or even whole client apps in near future. We're interested to hear your thoughts on this.

#### What's your tech stack?

- macOS and iOS apps: Swift, mostly SwiftUI with core components (eg. message list and text editor) in UIKit/AppKit.
- Server: Bun with a Postgres database
- Web app: React
- Android: Kotlin
- Windows and Linux: Undecided
